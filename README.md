</p>
Our team focused on the aging problem, which is a social problem in Korea. Along with the increase in the number of the elderly, the number of elderly people living alone is also increasing. As a result, the number of elderly people that a caregiver has to take care of is inevitably increasing. We tried to develop an application to solve this problem, and the app that was born in that way is 'knockknock'.

## üëü How To Run Code
<ol>
  <li>
    First, please accept the code of GitHub as a zip file and decompress it.
  </li><br>
  <li>
    We developed the application using flutter. If you don't have flutter installed, please install it.
  </li><br>
  <li>
    Since our project utilizes the function of firebase, please execute the following command at the terminal of the project document location.<br>
	  
	  flutter pub add firebase_core
	  flutter pub add firebase_auth
	  flutter pub add cloud_firestore

If an error occurs, please enter the following command at the terminal.<br>
  
	  flutter pub upgrade

  </li><br>
   <li>
	Execute the code.<br>
	   The best recommendation to run is to use the emulator. As we designed the UI to match with iPhone 14 Pro, we recommend running the emulator with the iPhone 14 Pro.<br>
	   If there is a problem with running the emulator, you can check it by running code in Chrome.
   </li>
</ol>
