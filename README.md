Our team focused on the aging problem, which is a social problem in Korea. Along with the increase in the number of the elderly, the number of elderly people living alone is also increasing. As a result, the number of elderly people that a caregiver has to take care of is inevitably increasing. We tried to develop an application to solve this problem, and the app that was born in that way is 'knockknock'.
